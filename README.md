# Psychic-Game
A game where the user tries to guess the letter that the computer is thinking of.

How to play:
You have nine chances to guess what letter the program is "thinking of". If you are correct, the Wins counter will increase by one, the number of guesses remaining resets to 9, and the program will choose a new letter for you to guess. If you do not guess correctly before your guesses run out, the game restarts as in the win case, except the Losses counter will increase by one instead of the Wins counter.
